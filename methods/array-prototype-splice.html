    // Function Signature: let arrDeletedItems = array.splice(start[, deleteCount[, item1[, item2[, ...]]]])

    /* 
        The splice() method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place.

        //startIndex
            The index at which to start changing the array.
            If startIndex > originalArray ==> startIndex = originalArray.length (No elements are deleted, and itemsN are pushed to the end of originalArray.) 
            If startIndex < 0 ==> startIndex === startIndex - originalArray.length - 1 (it will begin that many elements from the end of the array. (In this case, the origin -1, meaning -n is the index of the nth last element, and is therefore equivalent to the index of array.length - n.) 
            If array.length + startIndex < 0 ==> startIndex === 0.

        //deleteCount
            If NO deleteCount is omitted ==> delete all elements after startIndex.
            If deleteCount >= array.length - startIndex ==> delete all elements after startIndex.

        //itemN
        If NO itemN ==> splice() will only remove elements.
        If itemN ==> push all items to oriinalArray from startIndex.

        If numberOfItemsN > numberOfDeletedItems ==> originalArray.length will change. 

        //Returned Value

        Default ==> return arrayOfDeletedItems.
        If no elements are removed ==> return [];
